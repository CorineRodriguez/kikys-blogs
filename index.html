    <span class="byline">Kiky's Blog</span>
    <p>"Although the number of people online might not seem to have much to do with blogs, it does reflect the size of the anticipated audience for bloggers. Out of the more than 7.5 billion people in the world, more than four billion are online, and that number is only expected to continue to grow"</p>

    <p>"Sometimes, readers just want a little snack. They have no need for an in-depth, detailed report on every single topic. In 2019, go ahead and jump into producing more short-form content, such as micro-blog posts, quickie videos, and attention-grabbing graphics"</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <h2>"Around 55 percent of companies stated that blogging was a top marketing priority in 2018."</h2>
    </div>

    <p>"More than half of all internet users use a mobile device to get online and read blogs, and the average person spends around 3.5 hours on a mobile device daily. What this means for bloggers in 2019 is that your blog must be optimized for mobile devices"</p>
